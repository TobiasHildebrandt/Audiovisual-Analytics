Interactive javascript-based visualization and sonification of NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions

This prototype presents the publically available NYPD Motor Vehicle Collision data (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95) using visuals and sound. It was build for participation in the BTW Data Science Challenge (http://btw2017.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/?pageId=CallForDSChallenge&language=en).

Authors: Tobias Hildebrandt, Conrad Indiono

The audiovisual user interface requires a database loaded with the data set as well as the data handling service by Conrad Indiono (link will follow). Furthermore, it requires a Mapbox-token or an alternative map provider.
